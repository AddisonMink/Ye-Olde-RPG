# Combat

## The Combat Round
Combat consists of 10-second rounds.

Each combatant rolls initiative at the beginning of each round. Higher numbers go first.

```
initiative = 1d6 + dexterity modifier
```

Actions taken on the same initiative count resolve simultaneously.

If a combatant is unaware of the other party when combat begins, they are surprised and they don't act on the first round of combat.

## Your Turn
You have 2 actions per turn. Actions include:
* Move
* Attack
* Special (e.g. casting a spell, turning undead)

## Movement
Your movement speed is determined by your armor.

| Armor   | Speed |
|---------|-------|
| None    | 40'   |
| Leather | 30'   |
| Metal   | 20'   |

## Engagement
If a combatant is within melee attack range of you and is aware of your presence, you are engaged with that combatant.

If you leave that combatant's melee range while engaged with them, they are allowed an attack of opportunity.

An attack of opportunity is free melee attack with a +2 bonus. A combatant can only perform 1 attack of opportunity per round.

## Flanking
Combatants get a +2 bonus on attack rolls if they are flanking their target.

A combatant is flanking an enemy under these conditions:
* The enemy is engaged with the combatant and at least 1 ally.
* A line can be drawn between the combatant and the ally that intersects the enemy.

## Attacking
```
melee attack roll = 1d20 + attack bonus + strength modifier

ranged attack roll = 1d20 + attack bonus + dexterity modifier

melee damage roll = weapon dice + weapon bonus + strength bonus

ranged damage roll = weapon dice + weapon bonus
```

If you are engaged with an enemy, you get a -5 penalty on ranged attack rolls.

If your target is unaware of you, you get a +2 bonus on all attack rolls.

## Death
When a combatant's hp drops to 0 or below, they must make a saving throw vs. death. If they succeed, they are unconscious with 0 HP. If they fail, they die.

Melee attacks against an unconscious creature hit automatically.

If a combatant's hp drops below the negative of their constitution score, they die immediately. For example, a player if 9 constitution dies immediately when they reach -10 hp.

An unconscious combatant regains consciousness when their HP is restored to 1 or more.

Note that creatures naturally heal 1 hp/day, so if a player drops to 0 hp and succeeds at their death save, they will naturally regain consciousness in 24 hours.
